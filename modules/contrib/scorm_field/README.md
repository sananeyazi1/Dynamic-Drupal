# Scorm field

This module adds a scorm player field type that gives you the ability to add a scorm field to an entity. 

## Installation

Install the module like any other drupal module.

## Configration

Add a new field to your entity and choose "Scorm field". You will find it in the section "Reference fields".

### Decoupled mode

If you'd like to run the field in decoupled mode please visit to admin/config/system/scorm_field/settings

Please also create a view mode named "decoupled" for the entity to have attached the scorm field.

We recommend you install x_frame_options_configuration to allow your backend server to be accessed through an iframe on a different domain.
